===================

This is the templating for the upcoming Drexel Students for Christ website.  It's based on [XSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL).  Depending on the client's browser using the default XSL parser, or on the client using javascript, or on the server.  Regardless, the objective of this project is to transform the relatively utilitarian XML output by the server into something pretty.
